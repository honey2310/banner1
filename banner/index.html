            <P>Online hotel reservations are a popular method for booking hotel rooms.
                 Travellers can book rooms on a computer by using online security to protect their privacy and financial information and by using several online travel agents to compare prices and facilities at different hotels.
                 Prior to the Internet, travellers could write, telephone the hotel directly, or use a travel agent to make a reservation. Nowadays, online travel agents have pictures of hotels and rooms, information on prices and deals, and even information on local resorts.
                 Many also allow reviews of the traveler to be recorded with the online travel agent. </P>
